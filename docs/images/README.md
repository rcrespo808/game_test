# Game Screenshots

This folder contains screenshots and images used in the project documentation.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. **Take a screenshot** of your game:
   - Menu screen: Show the MIDI file and difficulty selection
   - Gameplay: Show the game in action with hazards and grid

2. **Save the screenshot**:
   - Recommended format: PNG (best quality) or JPG (smaller file size)
   - Recommended dimensions: 800x600 or 1280x720 for good quality
   - Save with descriptive names:
     - `game-screenshot.png` - Main gameplay screenshot
     - `menu-screenshot.png` - Menu screen
     - `gameplay-screenshot.png` - Gameplay in action

3. **Update README.md** to reference your screenshots:
   ```markdown
   ![Game Screenshot](docs/images/game-screenshot.png)
   ```

## Tools for Taking Screenshots

- **Windows**: `Windows + Shift + S` (Snipping Tool) or `Print Screen`
- **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + 4` (area selection) or `Cmd + Shift + 3` (full screen)
- **Linux**: `Print Screen` or use a screenshot tool like `gnome-screenshot`
